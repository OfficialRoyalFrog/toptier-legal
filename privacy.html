<h1>Top Tier List – Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: July 22, 2025</strong></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Top Tier List (“<strong>Service</strong>,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares your information. By using the Service, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Information</strong> – e-mail address, username, and profile image you provide when you create an account or sign in with Google, Apple, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage Data</strong> – device type, IP address, crash logs, and in-app analytics (e.g., button taps, screen views).</li>
  <li><strong>User-Generated Content</strong> – tier lists, images, comments, and other content you submit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Service.</li>
  <li>Personalize features such as saving and syncing your tier lists.</li>
  <li>Moderate, filter, and remove content that violates our <a href="Terms.html">Terms of Use</a>.</li>
  <li>Send product updates, support messages, or promotional e-mails (opt-out anytime).</li>
  <li>Monitor usage trends, debug crashes, and improve performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>We never sell your personal data. We share information only:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With trusted service providers that process data for us (hosting, analytics, authentication, payment, moderation).</li>
  <li>When required by law or to defend our legal rights.</li>
  <li>With your consent or at your direction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We integrate services such as Firebase (authentication, cloud storage, crash reporting), Google Analytics (usage analytics), and Google Content Safety APIs (automatic content moderation). If you use the free, ad-supported version, we may also use advertising networks (e.g., Google AdMob). Each provider has its own privacy policy. We encourage you to review their terms.</p>

<h2>6. Content Moderation &amp; User Safety</h2>
<p>To protect users and comply with our Terms, we process user-generated text and images through automated moderation services (e.g., Google Content Safety API) to detect potentially objectionable or harmful content. Moderation data is used only for safety and compliance, not for targeted advertising. You can also manually report content or block other users in-app. We review reports within 24 hours and may remove content or suspend accounts that violate our Terms.</p>

<h2>7. Advertising &amp; Tracking (if applicable)</h2>
<p>If you use the free, ad-supported version, our advertising partners may collect or receive device identifiers (including IDFA on iOS) for purposes such as frequency capping, fraud prevention, and ad measurement. We honor Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework and will request your permission before tracking. You can manage tracking permissions in your device settings.</p>

<h2>8. International Transfers &amp; Legal Basis (GDPR/UK GDPR)</h2>
<p>Our servers are located in the United States. If you access the Service from outside the U.S., you consent to transferring and processing your data in the U.S.</p>
<p>For users in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, we rely on these legal bases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Contract (Art. 6 (1)(b))</strong> – processing account and subscription data to deliver the Service.</li>
  <li><strong>Legitimate Interest (Art. 6 (1)(f))</strong> – collecting analytics, crash reports, and moderation data to improve quality, safety, and security.</li>
  <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 (1)(a))</strong> – sending marketing e-mails or push notifications, and tracking for advertising.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Security</h2>
<p>We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your data, but no system can be guaranteed 100% secure.</p>

<h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect data from minors. Contact us if you believe a child has provided personal data so we can delete it.</p>

<h2>11. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes in this Policy or to comply with legal obligations. Backup copies may persist for up to 30 days before automated deletion.</p>

<h2>12. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on your region, you may have the right to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access a copy of your personal data.</li>
  <li>Correct or update inaccurate data.</li>
  <li>Delete your account and associated data (see §15).</li>
  <li>Object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
  <li>Opt out of marketing e-mails or push notifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these actions can be performed in-app under <em>Settings → Account</em> or by e-mailing us at
<a href="mailto:officialroyalfrog@gmail.com">officialroyalfrog@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Policy periodically. We will post the latest version here and update the “Last Updated” date. Continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the revised Policy.</p>

<h2>14. Contact Us</h2>
<p>Questions or concerns? E-mail us at <a href="mailto:officialroyalfrog@gmail.com">officialroyalfrog@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h2>15. Account Deletion</h2>
<p>You can request permanent deletion of your account and data at any time via in-app <em>Settings → Account → Delete Account</em> or by sending an e-mail to
<a href="mailto:officialroyalfrog@gmail.com">officialroyalfrog@gmail.com</a>. We will honor verified deletion requests within 30 days, unless we must retain certain information to meet legal obligations.</p>

<p>Thank you for using Top Tier List.</p>
