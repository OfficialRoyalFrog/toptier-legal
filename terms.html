<h1>Top Tier List – Terms of Use</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: July 22, 2025</strong></p>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms &amp; Age Requirement</h2>
<p>By downloading or using Top Tier List (“<strong>Service</strong>,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) you agree to these Terms of Use (“<strong>Terms</strong>”). You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction) to use the Service. If you do not agree to these Terms, please uninstall the app and discontinue use.</p>

<h2>2. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may revise these Terms at any time and will post the updated version here. Continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

<h2>3. License and Restrictions</h2>
<p>You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Service for personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not violate any laws or regulations.</li>
  <li>Do not infringe upon intellectual-property rights.</li>
  <li>Do not upload or share harmful, obscene, or unlawful content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Your Account</h2>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms.</p>

<h2>5. Subscriptions, Payments &amp; Refunds</h2>
<p>Certain features require a paid subscription that auto-renews unless canceled in your App Store account settings. By subscribing, you agree to the price, billing schedule, and renewal terms shown at checkout. You can cancel anytime; your subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period. Refunds are handled solely by the App Store according to its policies—we cannot issue refunds directly.</p>

<h2>6. User-Generated Content</h2>
<p>If you upload content (e.g., tier lists, images, comments) you confirm you own or have rights to that content and grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to display and distribute it within the app. We may remove content that violates these Terms or applicable laws.</p>

<h2>7. DMCA / Copyright Complaints</h2>
<p>If you believe content on the Service infringes your copyright, e-mail a takedown request to <a href="mailto:officialroyalfrog@gmail.com">officialroyalfrog@gmail.com</a> with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your contact details and a physical or electronic signature;</li>
  <li>Identification of the copyrighted work and the infringing material;</li>
  <li>A statement that you have a good-faith belief the disputed use is not authorized;</li>
  <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that your notice is accurate.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will promptly remove or disable access to the material upon receiving a valid notice.</p>

<h2>8. Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms, abuse the platform, or act unlawfully. You may stop using the Service at any time by uninstalling the app.</p>

<h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p>The Service is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.</p>

<h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Service. Our total liability will not exceed the amount you paid for the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</p>

<h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Oregon, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles and without prejudice to any mandatory consumer-protection laws in your country of residence. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Oregon for any disputes.</p>

<h2>12. Severability &amp; Waiver</h2>
<p>If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in full force. Our failure to enforce any right is not a waiver of that right.</p>

<h2>13. Contact &amp; Support</h2>
<p>For account or billing issues, please contact <a href="mailto:officialroyalfrog@gmail.com">officialroyalfrog@gmail.com</a> before seeking third-party remedies. 
</p>

<p>Thank you for using Top Tier List.</p>
